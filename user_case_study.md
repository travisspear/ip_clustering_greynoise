# GreyNoise DataSci User Grouping Case Study
This is an example project for Data Science at GreyNoise

## Description
For this project we'd like you to take our business intelligence data and try to identify users that have similar patterns of use so we can better serve their needs. Included is a csv of mock api usage for a set of users over a 16 week period. There are five different types of APIs included, which should be considered different use cases (for this exercise the definitions don't matter, just that they are different and different users would use different combinations at different ammunts).

See: `user_api_data.csv`

## Goal
Your challenge is to find groups within this set that seem to have similar usage patterns. There are a lot of ways to slice this problem, so part of the task is to think about what you can do to turn this into cohesive groups.

## Deliverable
1. Initial thinking and plan of action. *This is the most important part.*
2. A csv of relevant groups found with their corresponding api usage metrics.
3. Some code (jupyter notebook, python script, javascript, go, or R) to reproduce your results. Don't worry about packaging imports or cleaning up file system references.
4. Afterthoughts and where you could go with more time.

## What we don't expect from you:
- Perfection
- More than two hours of effort
    - Completion is not the only metric.
    - Initial thoughts, partial code, and describing what you did is most important.
    - A well thought out plan is more important than a final result.
